### What I did
- Reviewed code structure differences (class vs direct)
- Learned core concepts: classes, objects, widgets, arguments, properties

### What I learned
- Class = blueprint (like Java)
- Object = the built thing (when you write Container())
- Widget = class for UI elements
- Argument = what you put in ()
- Property = named setting (name: value)
- VS Code colors: green = classes, blue = properties, yellow = functions
