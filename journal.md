### What I did
- Installed Flutter SDK
- Set up VS Code with Flutter extensions
- Created GitHub repository with proper structure
- Learned Flutter basics (widget tree, gradients)

### What I learned
- Flutter apps are widgets inside widgets
- `child:` = "what goes inside this box"
- VS Code colors: green = widgets, blue = properties
- Git workflow: add, commit, push

### Next steps
- Continue with Lesson 36 (Custom Widgets)

### What I did
- Reviewed code structure differences (class vs direct)
- Learned core concepts: classes, objects, widgets, arguments, properties

### What I learned
- Class = blueprint (like Java)
- Object = the built thing (when you write Container())
- Widget = class for UI elements
- Argument = what you put in ()
- Property = named setting (name: value)
- VS Code colors: green = classes, blue = properties, yellow = functions

### Next steps

## 18.01.2026

### What I did
- Created custom widgets using classes
- Built GradientContainer, StyledText, and SubtitleText widgets
- Organized code into separate files
- Experimented with adding subtitle (not from course!)

### What I learned
- `class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget` = custom widget
- `const MyWidget({super.key})` = constructor with key for performance
- `@override` and `build(context)` = how widget looks
- `child:` only accepts ONE widget
- `Column(children: [...])` for multiple widgets vertically
- `mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center` = center vertically
- `width: double.infinity` = take full width
- One widget = one file (clean code)

### Challenges
- Had to look at previous code often
- Needed help with double.infinity

### Next steps
- Continue with Roll Dice App
- Create notes folder for learning notes
